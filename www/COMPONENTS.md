## Usage (Already Implemented!)

The new `index.astro` is now live and uses all components:

```astro
---
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Navigation from '../components/Navigation.astro';
import Hero from '../components/Hero.astro';
import TrustSignals from '../components/TrustSignals.astro';
import Features from '../components/Features.astro';
import Problem from '../components/Problem.astro';
import HowItWorks from '../components/HowItWorks.astro';
import Comparison from '../components/Comparison.astro';
import Testimonials from '../components/Testimonials.astro';
import FAQ from '../components/FAQ.astro';
import CTA from '../components/CTA.astro';
import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
import CommandPalette from '../components/CommandPalette.astro';
import CursorSpotlight from '../components/CursorSpotlight.astro';
import ClientScripts from '../components/ClientScripts.astro';
---

<Layout>
	<Navigation />
	<CommandPalette />
	<CursorSpotlight />
	
	<main>
		<Hero />
		<TrustSignals />
		<Features />
		<Problem />
		<HowItWorks />
		<Comparison />
		<Testimonials />
		<FAQ />
		<CTA />
	</main>
	
	<Footer />
	<ClientScripts />
</Layout>
```

The old monolithic `index.astro` has been backed up as `index-old.astro`.

## Component Guidelines

### Structure
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Include all CSS within the component's `<style>` tag
- Use scoped styles by default
- Export props via frontmatter when needed

### Naming
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Be descriptive: `Features.astro` not `F.astro`
- Group related components in subdirectories if needed

### Styling
- Use CSS variables from Layout for consistency
- Keep responsive styles within the component
- Use the `.scroll-reveal` class for animations

### Scripts
- Keep interactive logic in `ClientScripts.astro`
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Add null checks for DOM queries

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Maintainability** - Each section is isolated and easy to update
✅ **Reusability** - Components can be reused across pages
✅ **Testability** - Components can be tested independently
✅ **Performance** - Astro's zero-JS by default
✅ **Developer Experience** - Easier to navigate and understand
✅ **Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on different components
